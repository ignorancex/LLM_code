#Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
#
#Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
#conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
#original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
#and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
#following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
#exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
#
#     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
#     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
#     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
#     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
#     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
#     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
#     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
#     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
#     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
#     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
#     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
#     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

#
#     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
#     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
#     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
#     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
#     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
#     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
#     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
#     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
#     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
#     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
#     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
#     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
#     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
#     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

#  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
#     under this Public License.
#
#  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
#     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
#     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
#     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
#     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
#     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
#     exchange.
#

#     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
#
#  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
#     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
#
#
#Section 2 -- Scope.
#
#  a. License grant.
#
#       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
#          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
#          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
#          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
#
#            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
#               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
#
#            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
#               NonCommercial purposes only.
#
#       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
#          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
#          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
#          its terms and conditions.
#
#       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
#          6(a).
#
#       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
#          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
#          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
#          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
#          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
#          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
#          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
#          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
#          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
#          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
#          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
#
#       5. Downstream recipients.
#
#            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
#               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
#               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
#               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
#               Public License.
#
#            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
#               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
#               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
#               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
#               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
#               Material.
#
#       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
#          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
#          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
#          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
#          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
#          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
#
#  b. Other rights.
#
#       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
#          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
#          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
#          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
#          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
#          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
#          Rights, but not otherwise.
#
#       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
#          Public License.
#
#       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
#          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
#          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
#          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
#          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
#          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
#          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
#          purposes.
#
#
#Section 3 -- License Conditions.
#
#Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
#following conditions.
#
#  a. Attribution.
#
#       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
#          form), You must:
#
#            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
#               with the Licensed Material:
#
#                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
#                    Material and any others designated to receive
#                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
#                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
#                    designated);
#
#                ii. a copyright notice;
#
#               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
#
#                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
#                    warranties;
#
#                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
#                    extent reasonably practicable;
#
#            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
#               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
#
#            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
#               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
#               hyperlink to, this Public License.
#
#       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
#          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
#          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
#          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
#          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
#          information.
#
#       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
#          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
#          reasonably practicable.
#
#       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
#          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
#          Material from complying with this Public License.
#
#
#Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
#
#Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
#apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
#
#  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
#     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
#     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
#     only;
#
#  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
#     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
#     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
#
#  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
#     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
#
#For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
#replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
#Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
#
#
#Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
#
#  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
#     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
#     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
#     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
#     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
#     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
#     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
#     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
#     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#
#  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
#     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
#     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
#     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
#     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
#     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
#     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
#     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
#     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#
#  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
#     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
#     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
#     waiver of all liability.
#
#
#Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
#
#  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
#     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
#     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
#     terminate automatically.
#
#  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
#     Section 6(a), it reinstates:
#
#       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
#          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
#          violation; or
#
#       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
#
#     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
#     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
#     of this Public License.
#
#  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
#     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
#     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
#     will not terminate this Public License.
#
#  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
#     License.
#
#
#Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
#
#  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
#     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
#
#  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
#     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
#     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
#
#
#Section 8 -- Interpretation.
#
#  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
#     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
#     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
#     be made without permission under this Public License.
#
#  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
#     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
#     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
#     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
#     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
#     conditions.
#
#  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
#     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
#     Licensor.
#
#  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
#     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
#     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
#     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
