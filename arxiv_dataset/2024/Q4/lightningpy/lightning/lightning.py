'''An object-oriented interface for Lightning.

    TODO:
    - Move imports around, to only where they're needed?
    - Standardize variable names
    - Documentation
    - Throughout the whole package we use (abuse?) the fact that
      np.log(0) := -np.inf for the computation of log probabilities.
      This works as intended in general, but generates lots of warning
      messages, which may lead an end user to believe that something is
      wrong when everything is working as intended.

class Lightning:
    '''The main interface for fitting a galaxy SED model.

    Holds information about the filters, observed flux, type of model.
    Model components are set by keyword choices.

    The only strictly required parameters are ``filter_labels`` and one of ``redshift`` or
    ``lum_dist``. For inference/fitting, both ``flux_obs`` and ``flux_unc`` must also be set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filter_labels : list, str
        List of filter labels.
    redshift : float
        Redshift of the model. If set, ``lum_dist`` is ignored. (Default: None)
    lum_dist : float
        Luminosity distance to the model. If ``redshift`` is not set,
        this parameter must be. If a luminosity distance is provided
        instead of a redshift, the redshift is set to 0 (as we assume
        the galaxy is very nearby). (Default: None)
    flux_obs : np.ndarray, (Nfilters,) or (Nfilters, 2), float32, optional
        The observed flux densities in *mJy*, or, optionally, the
        observed flux densities and associated uncertainties as a
        2D array. (Default: None)
    flux_unc : np.ndarray, (Nfilters,), float32, optional
        The uncertainties associated with ``flux_obs``, in *mJy*. (Default: None)
    wave_grid : tuple (3,), or np.ndarray, (Nwave,), float32, optional
        Either a tuple of (lo, hi, Nwave) specifying a log-spaced rest-frame wavelength grid, or an array
        giving the wavelengths directly. (Default: (0.1, 1000, 1200))
    stellar_type : {'PEGASE', 'PEGASE-A24', 'BPASS', 'BPASS-A24', 'BPASS-ULX-G24'}
        String specifying the simple stellar population models to use. 'PEGASE' gives the stellar population models
        used in IDL Lightning (Doore+2023). (Default: 'PEGASE')
    line_labels : np.ndarray, (Nlines,), string, optional
        Line labels in the format used by pyCloudy. See `lightning/models/linelist_full.txt` for the
        complete list of available lines in the grid and their format. (Default: None)
    line_flux : np.ndarray, (Nlines,) or (Nlines, 2), float32, optional
        Observed integrated fluxes of the lines in *erg cm-2 s-1* (unless the ``line_index`` keyword is set, in which
        case they should be normalized by the appropriate line). (Default: None)
    line_flux_unc : np.ndarray,(Nlines,), float32, optional
        Uncertainties on the integrated line fluxes in *erg cm-2 s-1* (unless ``line_index`` is set, see above) (Default: None)
    line_index : string
        Label for the line to index the line fluxes by. You would normally want this to be ``'H__1_486132A'`` or
        ``'H__1_656280A'`` for Hbeta and Halpha, respectively, but the highest SNR line could be a good choice.
        If this is set to ``None`` then the model line fluxes are not normalized for fitting. (Default: None)
    nebula_lognH : float
        log of the Hydrogen density in cm-3 for the Cloudy grids. (Default: 2.0)
    nebula_dust : bool
        If ``True``, then dust grains are included in the Cloudy grids. (Default: False)
    SFH_type : {'Piecewise-Constant', 'Delayed-Exponential', 'Single-Exponential', 'Burst'}
        String specifying the SFH type to use. (Default: 'Piecewise-Constant')
    ages : np.ndarray, (Nages,), float32
        Array giving the stellar ages (or stellar age bins) of the stellar
        population models. Default depends on the model and redshift.
    atten_type : {'Modified-Calzetti', 'Calzetti'}
        String specifying the dust attenuation model to use. (Default: 'Modified-Calzetti')
    dust_emission : bool
        If ``True``, a Draine & Li (2007) dust emission model is included,
        in energy balance with the attenuated power. (Default: False)
    agn_emission : bool
        If ``True``, a Stalevski et al. (2016) UV-IR AGN emission model is
        included. (Default: False)
    agn_polar_dust : bool
        If ``True``, AGN polar dust extinction and re-emission are implemented following the recipe from X-Cigale. Note
        that even if this keyword is set to ``False``, the polar dust optical depth remains a parameter of the
        model - it just doesn't do anything, and should held at 0 in any fitting. (Default: False)
    xray_mode : {'flux', 'counts', 'None', None}
        String specifying the mode for X-ray model fitting - fluxes are fit like any other point in the SED, while
        counts are folded through the instrumental response. Expect counts mode to be more flexible but harder to set
        up. If you are fitting X-ray data from multiple instruments simultaneously, you must set this to 'flux' (and should
        convert your instrumental countrates to fluxes assuming the same spectrum for every instrument). (Default: None)
    xray_stellar_emission : {'Stellar-Plaw', 'None', None}
        String specifying the X-ray stellar model. Currently the only available model is 'Stellar-Plaw', which uses
        the Gilbertson+(2022) LX-stellar age scaling relation to calculate the luminosity.  (Default: None)
    xray_agn_emission : {'AGN-Plaw', 'QSOSED', 'None', None}
        String specifying the X-ray AGN model. The 'AGN-Plaw' model is a power law sclaed by the Lusso & Risaliti (2017)
        empirical L2500-L2keV relationship; the QSOSED model is a theoretical accretion disk + comptonization model
        that sets the normalization of the whole X-ray-to-IR AGN model as a function of M and mdot. (Default: None)
    xray_absorption : {'tbabs', 'phabs', 'None', None}
        String specifying the X-ray absorption model to use. Two instances are used, one in the rest frame describing the
        intrinsic absorption, and one in the observed frame with a constant Galactic NH. (Default: None)
    xray_wave_grid : tuple (3,), or np.ndarray, (Nwave,), float32, optional
        Either a tuple of (lo, hi, Nwave) specifying a log-spaced rest-frame wavelength grid, or an array
        giving the wavelengths directly. At high redshift this should be constructed carefully to ensure that
        your bands are covered. (Default: (1e-6, 1e-1, 200))
    xray_arf : dict or astropy.table.Table or numpy structured array
        A structure defining the anciliary response function (ARF) of your X-ray observations. The structure must have
        three keys, `'ENERG_LO'`, `'ENERG_HI'`, and `'SPECRESP'`, which given the energy bins and binned spectral response
        respectively. Only used if `xray_mode='counts'``. (Default: None)
    xray_exposure : float or np.ndarray (Nfilters)
        A scalar or array giving the exposure time of the X-ray observations. If an array, it should have the same
        length as ``filter_labels``, with all non-X-ray bands having their exposure time set to 0. Note that you almost
        certainly don't need to give exposure time as an array, since the energy dependence of the effective area
        is explicitly given by the ARF. Only used if ``xray_mode='counts'``. (Default: None)
    galactic_NH : float
        A scalar giving the Galactic column density along the line of sight to the source in *1e20 cm-2*. (Default: 0.0)
    print_setup_time : bool
        If ``True``, the setup time will be printed. (Default: False)
    model_unc : np.ndarray, (Nfilters,), float, or float
        Fractional (i.e. [0,1)) model uncertainty to include in the fits. If
        a scalar is provided, the same model uncertainty is applied to each filter.
        Alternately, model uncertainties can be provided as an array, one per filter.
        The smarter way to do this in the future may be to set model uncertainties per
        component, rather than per filter. (Default: None)
    model_unc_lines : np.ndarray, (Nlines,), float, or float
        Fractional (i.e. [0,1)) model uncertainty to include in the line fits. (Default: None)
    cosmology : astropy.cosmology.FlatLambdaCDM
        The cosmology to assume. Lightning defaults to a flat cosmology with ``h=0.7 and Om0=0.3``.
    uplim_handling : {'exact', 'approx'}
        A string specifying how upper limits are to be handled. In the case of 'exact' we treat
        them as derived in e.g. Appendix A of Sawicki et al. (2012). In the case of 'approx', upper limits
        are treated as measurements of 0 with a 1 sigma uncertainty equal to the 1 sigma flux limit. This option
        is provided for consistency with the handling of limits in IDL lightning. Our convention for inputting upper
        limits remains that they should be specified as a measurement of 0 with a 1 sigma uncertainty equal to the
        1 sigma flux limit. (Default: 'exact')

        The L-BFGS-B algorithm is a good general-use choice for minimization, and allows the use of box bounds. Here we also
        add the option for an `MCMC_followup` -- rather than computing uncertainties by brute force (calculating dchi2
        on a grid in the vicinity of the solution) or by naive Monte Carlo (perturbing the photometry and refitting
        ~100 times to observe the spread of the solutions), we explore the region around the solution with emcee. This
        is fairly time-efficient.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p0 : np.ndarray, (Nparams,)
            Initial point for the minimization algorithm.
        disp : bool
            If `True`, print the output from scipy.optimize.minimize.
        maxiter : int
            Maximum number of iterations for the minimizer. By default, this is 500 times the number of parameters.
        MCMC_followup : bool
            If `True`, perform the MCMC followup briefly described above.
        force : bool
            If `True`, try to do the MCMC followup even if the solver did not succesfully converge. The solver can, e.g.
            fail if it arrives at a region of parameter space where gradient is too flat, whereas the mcmc may
            successfully escape this region.
        MCMC_kwargs : dict
            Keywords passed through to Lightning.fit(method='emcee'), i.e. `Nwalkers` and `Nsteps`. The keyword
            `init_scale` is not passed through (yet, I'll probably change that), and is just used to initialize the MCMC
            ensemble in a Gaussian ball around the BFGS solution.
        bounds : list of tuple
            Each element of this list should be a tuple giving the lower and upper bounds on the corresponding parameter.
            For constant parameters, set the lower bound and upper bound equal to each other. To use the default (widest)
            bounds for the given parameter, replace the tuple with `None`.
