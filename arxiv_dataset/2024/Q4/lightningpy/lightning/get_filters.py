def get_filters(filter_labels, wave_grid):
    '''Look up and load filters from files.

    Filters are interpolated to a common wavelength grid. Completely
    non-overlapping filters are set to NaN. Note that filters have all
    been previously re-normalized to an equal-energy response.

    TODO:
        - Set option to disallow partial overlap?

    Parameters
    ----------
    filter_labels : array-like, str
        List of labels for filters.
    wave_grid : array-like, float
        Wavelength grid in microns to interpolate filters on. Filters will be
        normalized on this grid, so if you want to integrate them against nu later you'll need to
        re-normalize.

    Returns
    -------
    filters : dict
        with keys pulled from ``filter_labels`` and values equal to the normalized transmission of the
        filter.
