        A UNet++ implementation with 1D/2D/3D supports.

        Based on:

            Zhou et al. "UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image
            Segmentation". 4th Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis (DLMIA)
            Workshop, DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1807.10165

        Args:
            spatial_dims: number of spatial dimensions. Defaults to 3 for spatial 3D inputs.
            in_channels: number of input channels. Defaults to 1.
            out_channels: number of output channels. Defaults to 2.
            features: six integers as numbers of features.
                Defaults to ``(32, 32, 64, 128, 256, 32)``,

                - the first five values correspond to the five-level encoder feature sizes.
                - the last value corresponds to the feature size after the last upsampling.

            deep_supervision: whether to prune the network at inference time. Defaults to False. If true, returns a list,
                whose elements correspond to outputs at different nodes.
            act: activation type and arguments. Defaults to LeakyReLU.
            norm: feature normalization type and arguments. Defaults to instance norm.
            bias: whether to have a bias term in convolution blocks. Defaults to True.
                According to `Performance Tuning Guide <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html>`_,
                if a conv layer is directly followed by a batch norm layer, bias should be False.
            dropout: dropout ratio. Defaults to no dropout.
