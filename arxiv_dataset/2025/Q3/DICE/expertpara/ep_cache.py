Cache structure:

DiEP enables async all2all (token dispatch and combine), this cache stores the all2all (results + meta + handler)l

We have a cache entry for each layer.

In step T, forward func calls async dispatch_async:

- recv the tokens from previous step (get this from cache)
- starts a new async all2all, to be received in next step,
    this async all2all shall be stored in this cache.

To store a all2all operation, we need to store the following data:
- a list of async op handles, since each dispatch/combine needs multiple dist.all_to_all
- recv_buf
- token_counts_local
- token_counts_global
- send_buf, incase it's released before op completes

"""

"""

Cache optimization

AUTO GC and OFFLOADING are orthogonal.

AUTO GC:
Free send_buf after all2all completes

OFFLOADING:

NO LONGER USED
Move recv_buf to cpu after all2all completes, move it back when time is ripe

Since the layers are access in a ring (layer 1..L then 1). 
We use a ring-style offloading, keeping only a continuous section of the recv_buf in GPU.
Leaving the rest in CPU.

Entry states:
- BUSY: all2all is in progress, recv_buf is in GPU
- LOADED: all2all is completed, recv_buf is in GPU or is being transferred to GPU
- OFFLOADED: all2all is completed, recv_buf is in CPU

offloading param:
prefetch_size: the size of the recv_buf to keep in GPU, 0 for no prefetch
