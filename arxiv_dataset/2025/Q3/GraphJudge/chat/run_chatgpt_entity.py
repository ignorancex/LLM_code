Transform the text into a list of entities.

Here are two examples:
Example#1:
Text: "Shotgate Thickets is a nature reserve in the United Kingdom operated by the Essex Wildlife Trust."
List of entities: ["Shotgate Thickets", "Nature reserve", "United Kingdom", "Essex Wildlife Trust"]
Example#2:
Text: "Garczynski Nunatak () is a cone-shaped nunatak, the highest in a cluster of nunataks close west of Mount Brecher, lying at the north flank of Quonset Glacier in the Wisconsin Range of the Horlick Mountains of Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1959–60, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Carl J. Garczynski, a meteorologist in the Byrd Station winter party, 1961."

Goal:

Here are two examples:
Example#1:

He is also an Afghanistan national football team player, and he has 9 caps in the history. He wears number 14 on his jersey and his position on field is centre back."
Entities: ["Zakria Rezai", "footballer", "Ordu Kabul F.C.", "Afghanistan", "29 July 1989"]
Denoised text: "Zakria Rezai is a footballer. Zakria Rezai is a member of the sports team Ordu Kabul F.C. Zakria Rezai has the citizenship of Afghanistan. Zakria Rezai was born on July 29, 1989. Ordu Kabul F.C. is a football club. Ordu Kabul F.C. is based in Afghanistan."
Example#2:
Raw text: "Elizabeth Smith, a renowned British artist, was born on 12 May 1978 in London. She is specialized in watercolor paintings and has exhibited her works in various galleries across the United Kingdom. Her most famous work, 'The Summer Breeze,' was sold at a prestigious auction for a record price. Smith is also a member of the Royal Society of Arts and has received several awards for her contributions to the art world."
