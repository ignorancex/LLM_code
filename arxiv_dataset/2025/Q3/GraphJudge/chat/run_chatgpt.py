Transform the text into a semantic graph.

Example#1:
Text: Shotgate \"Thickets is a nature reserve in the United Kingdom operated by the Essex Wildlife Trust.\"
Semantic Graph: 
```[["Shotgate Thickets", "instance of", "Nature reserve"], ["Shotgate Thickets", "country", "United Kingdom"], ["Shotgate Thickets", "operator", "Essex Wildlife Trust"]]```
Example#2:
Text: The Eiffel Tower, located in Paris, France, is a famous landmark and a popular tourist attraction. It was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889.
Semantic Graph:
```[["Eiffel Tower", "located in", "Paris"], ["Eiffel Tower", "located in", "France"], ["Eiffel Tower", "instance of", "landmark"], ["Eiffel Tower", "attraction type", "tourist attraction"],["Eiffel Tower", "designed by", "Gustave Eiffel"], ["Eiffel Tower", "completion year", "1889"]]```

Note: 
1. Make sure each item in the list is a triple with strictly three items.
2. Give me the answer in the form of a semantic graph extactly as example shown, which is a list of lists.
3. DO NOT output like '```json[ .. ]```', SHOUDLE BE LIKE '```[...]```'.

Text: \"{t}\"
