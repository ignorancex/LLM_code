    """Return train or val data loader for finetuning SAM for 2d semantic segmentation.

    The data loader must be a torch data loader that returns `x, y` tensors,
    where `x` is the image data and `y` are the labels.
    The labels have to be in a label mask semantic segmentation format.
    i.e. a tensor of the same spatial shape as `x`, with each object mask having its own ID.
    Important: the ID 0 is reserved for backgrund, and the other IDs must map to different classes.

    NOTE: The spatial shapes of images and corresponding labels are expected to be:
    `images: (B, C, Y, X)`, `labels: (B, 1, Y, X)` to train the 2d semantic segmentation model,
    where C corresponds to the number of channels in input data.
    (eg. the OCT images used in the example below are images with three channels)

    Here, we use `torch_em` based data loader, for creating a suitable data loader from
    OIMHS data. You can either see `torch_em.data.datasets.medical.get_oimhs_loader` for adapting
    this on your own data or write a suitable torch dataloader yourself.
